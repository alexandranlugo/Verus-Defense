# Verus Defense AI

> **AI-powered intelligence verification system for defense and intelligence applications.**

Verus Defense AI is a web-based dashboard that combines deepfake/manipulation detection, metadata analysis, cryptographic verification, and anomaly detection into a single intelligence console. The system uses AI scoring, blockchain-style integrity logs, and modern UI/UX to help defense teams rapidly authenticate sensitive media such as satellite imagery or drone footage.
